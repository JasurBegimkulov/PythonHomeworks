2) We use break to exit the loop and we use continue to skip the part of the iteration.
3)If you know the number of times you want to repeat something, you use for loop. While loop is used untill the condition is no lobger true.
4)A nested loop means placing one loop inside another to make many levels of iteration. For example:

for i in range(4):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(3):  # Inner loop
        print(f"Outer: {i}, Inner: {j}")
